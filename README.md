 
This project is a Windows Forms application that implements a comprehensive cryptographic suite combining classical encryption ciphers with modern Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). It provides both educational cryptographic algorithms and practical security features for file encryption, digital signatures, and certificate management.

### Main Function Points
- **Classical Ciphers Implementation**: Supports Myszkowski Transposition, Playfair Cipher, and Rail Fence Cipher for educational cryptography purposes
- **PKI Infrastructure**: Features a custom Certificate Authority (CA) server capable of generating and managing X.509 v3 digital certificates
- **User Certificate Generation**: Enables creation of user certificates using RSA and ECDSA algorithms
- **Secure Authentication**: Implements a login system with SHA-256 and SHA-3 hashing for password security
- **File Security Operations**: Provides file encryption/decryption capabilities using AES and RSA algorithms
- **Digital Signature Support**: Allows creation and verification of digital signatures for document authentication

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: .NET 6.0+ / .NET 8.0
- **Programming Language**: C# (100%)
- **Cryptography Library**: BouncyCastle
- **User Interface**: Windows Forms (WF App)
- **Operating System**: Windows OS
